# Analyze Rezept Flow

Analyzing a rezept image by ai is one of the main features of the app. The user can take a picture of a rezept and the app will analyze it and return the results. The analysis is done by a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of rezept images. The model is able to recognize the text in the image and extract the relevant information.

The Flow should be as follows:
1. The user takes a picture of the rezept.
2. The app sends the image to the server for analysis.
3. The server processes the image and returns the results.
4. The app displays the analyzed raw patient data next to the suggested already existing patient in the system.
5. The user confirms the suggested patient, or creates a new one prefilled with the analyzed data.
6. The app opens the rezept form prefilled with the analyzed data.
7. The user saves the new rezept
